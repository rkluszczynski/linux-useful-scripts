# IMPORTANT:
# * On most systems $MAILDIR is a subdirectory of $HOME
# * Upon reading a line that contains MAILDIR=
#     Procmail does a chdir to $MAILDIR
#      ...and $MAILDIR becomes the Procmail working directory
#       ...and relative paths are relative to $MAILDIR
# * Do not include a trailing slash in your MAILDIR setting
# * The $MAILDIR directory must exist and must be writable by
# your LOGNAME
# * The MAILDIR variable is an entirely different entity from
# maildir mailbox format
